## EECS 402 - Computer Programming For Scientists and Engineers

Presents concepts and hands-on experience for designing and writing programs using one or more programming languages currently important in solving real-world problems. Intended for senior undergraduates and graduate students in science or engineering fields.

Project 1 - Accure Interest calculator

Project 2 - Pixel and image representation

project 3 - Image modification (bounding boxes, pattern, and images)
The project requires a lot of bound checking. 

test.sh - test all the boundings for the image
  # test 1 - check the three methods of rectangle
             1. upper left and lower right
                should have 6 ERROR! while checking the bounding and valid  
             2. upper left
                should have 6 ERROR!
             3. center 
                should have 4 ERROR!
  # test 2 - pattern check
  # test 3 - image check
